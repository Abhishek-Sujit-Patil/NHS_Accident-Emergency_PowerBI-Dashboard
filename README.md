# NHS Accident & Emergency – Power BI Dashboard

This project showcases an end-to-end **Power BI data analytics solution** using publicly available **NHS Accident & Emergency (A&E) performance** and **hospital bed availability/occupancy** datasets.  
The goal is to explore trust-level resilience under operational pressure through **data prep, modelling, and interactive dashboards**.

---

## Key Highlights
- **Data Prep in Power Query (M):**  
  - [`All_M_queries_for_data_prep.txt`](All_M_queries_for_data_prep.txt) – complete M code for cleaning and shaping both A&E and KH03 Beds datasets.  
- **Data Model (Tabular):**  
  - [`Model_file.bim`](Model_file.bim) – semantic model definition (tables, relationships, metadata).  
- **DAX Measures:**  
  - [`Measures.csv`](Measures.csv) – exported measures driving KPIs and visuals.  
- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  - [`NHS_A&E_Performance_Report.pbix`](NHS_A&E_Performance_Report.pbix) – final Power BI report with insights.  

---

## How to Reproduce
1. Download the `.pbix` file and open in **Power BI Desktop**.  
2. Update parameter paths in Power Query (M) if loading raw data locally.  
3. Alternatively, browse the `.bim` and `.csv` files to explore the model and calculations separately.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced **Power Query (M)** transformations  
- **Data modelling** (relationships, lookup tables, custom keys)  
- **DAX measures** for KPI calculation  
- NHS data analysis & performance benchmarking  
- End-to-end **dashboard design** in Power BI

This project is part of my **portfolio** to demonstrate practical data analytics and business intelligence skills using **real healthcare datasets**.
